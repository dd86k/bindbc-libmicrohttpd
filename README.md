# bindbc-libmicrohttpd

Unofficial dynamic and bindings for libmicrohttpd, a small HTTP daemon library.

This was created rather quickly for a project, and currently supports 0.9.75.

On Windows, you'll need the
[libmicrohttpd-latest-w32-bin.zip](https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/) archive.

On Ubuntu, you'll need the `libmicrohttpd12` shared library package to run. Otherwise,
for the static configuration, the `libmicrohttpd-dev` package.
